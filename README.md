## Getting Started

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself

## Building the Project

The project uses C++ and requires some dependencies. We recommend using **vcpkg** to simplify the installation process.

### Installing Dependencies with vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg** installed, clone the repository and install it by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system PATH environment variable.
3.  Run the following commands to install dependencies:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install openssl
    ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install nlohmann-json
    ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install cryptopp
    ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install libsodium
    ```

4.  Once the dependencies are installed, build the project.

### Building with Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure that **vcpkg** is properly integrated (see [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio)).
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be located in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile the project using this command:

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line Options

Command line options:

1.  **-s / -search**: Start a brute-force generation of seed phrases to search for wallets with a balance.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Begin tracking the specified address. The program will monitor for activity.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate the specified number of Solana wallets. Replace `<NUMBER>` with the desired number.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Show wallet data using the provided seed phrase. Replace `<MNEMONIC>` with the seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Display the balance of a Solana address.
